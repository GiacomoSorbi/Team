- [The Real Beast](http://thebeast.me/about/) - Steak or Streak, ECC RAM Style :cancer:

John has worked on a number of projects for me over the past three years. His contributions have been significant to the successful deployment of an enterprise document publishing system. His skills in XSLT, XSD and XML, Ruby and Python, combine with a design approach that results in compact and agile code. His "outside-the-box" solutions have also proven their worth with ongoing maintenance and support.

- [Preston Hunter](https://www.upwork.com/users/~012ab645e1d96a5c7f) - Data Beast :capricorn:

Serious professional with over 20 years of experience as a programmer and database specialist. My emphasis has been on creating elegant SQL database design integrated with user-friendly front-end software (desktop and web applications).

I have worked mainly as a database designer, programmer and database administrator for bioinformatics, biochemistry, molecular biology, and biomedical research applications. I also have extensive experience programming database-centric software (websites, web applications, desktop applications) for publishing, business, financial, personnel and other purposes.

###Lead JavaScript / Python Programmer :de: :man:

- [Giacomo Sorbi](https://www.codewars.com/users/GiacomoSorbi) - Sensei

Passionate coder with a background in Business & Administration; seeker of new challenges, new problems to solve and new ways to test and hone my skills; puzzle-solver for a living.

Eager to learn something new every waking day, I discovered the joy and pleasure of "dirtying" my hands with analysis tools and programming whenever I get the chance; competitive coding in particular helped me a lot, offering me highly diversified algorithm-based problems, motivation and the chance to learn best practices from veteran coders.

A teacher at heart, I had been fortunate enough to pass what little I know to many people, thanks to my professional and volunteer activity. Interested in both corporate and start-up work experiences.
